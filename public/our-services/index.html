<p><strong>Our Assessors advise on whether an appeal against your business rates valuation is appropriate. Sometimes it is easy to forget that on appeal, valuations can increase as well as decrease. We can only make recommendations for a revaluation once your current circumstances have been assessed in full.</strong></p>
